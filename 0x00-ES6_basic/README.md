 0x00. ES6 Basics

 Overview
This project focuses on learning and implementing ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features in JavaScript. It covers various concepts such as arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, and iterables and iterators.

 Resources
Read or watch the following resources to understand the concepts of ES6:
- [ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f_2X1s_zk0)
- [Statements and declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Statements)
- [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- [Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters)
- [Rest parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)

 Requirements

 General
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `.js` extension
- Your code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework
- Your code will be analyzed using the linter ESLint along with specific rules that will be provided
- All of your functions must be exported

 Setup

 Install NodeJS 12.11.x
To install Node.js in your home directory, run the following commands:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```
Verify the installation:
```bash
nodejs -v
 v12.11.1

npm -v
 6.11.3
```

 Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint
In your project directory, install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by using the supplied `package.json` and run:
```bash
npm install
```

 Configuration Files
Add the following files to your project directory:

1. **`package.json`**
   - Click [here to show/hide file contents](#)

2. **`babel.config.js`**
   - Click [here to show/hide file contents](#)

3. **`.eslintrc.js`**
   - Click [here to show/hide file contents](#)

Finally, don’t forget to run `npm install` from the terminal of your project folder to install all necessary project dependencies.

 Usage
- Write your ES6 functions and export them as required.
- Run your tests using Jest to ensure your code works as expected.
- Use ESLint to analyze your code and adhere to best practices.

 Notes
- The links in the **Resources** section are placeholders. Please replace them with actual URLs or remove them if not needed.
- The file contents for `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, and `.eslintrc.js` are noted as clickable links. You can either provide the actual content directly in the README or replace the links with a proper hyperlink or code block for clarity.
- Feel free to modify any sections as necessary to better fit your project's specifics.
